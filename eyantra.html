<h2>This was a national robotics competition, organized by IIT-B and sponsored by MHRD india. The theme of this competition was "
MODEL A TERRAIN". The objective of this competition was to build a robot which can navigate unknown terrains while modelling the terrain. 
Such robots are essential for space expeditions as the terrain of the planets can be modelled,   which will act as a blueprint for planning further 
exploration. It will also help in detecting various hotspots where research samples are to be picked up. Also the robot will prevent the risk posed 
to humans while navigating unseen areas. The robot also has a compass fitted onto it which can help the explorers keep track of their location and 
return to their base location. I am proud to say that my team was one of the finalists in that competition with these <a href="image/eyantra.pdf"> ideas </a> .
