<h1>"FIGHT AND FLIGHT" </h1>

<h3>Fortunately,all fears are learned, no one is born with fear.The most common fear that we experience,
which often sabotage all hope for success,is the FEAR OF FAILURE, whose most common result is the attitude of ,"I can not!".
But by visualizing yourself,performing with confidence and competence in an area where you are fearful,
your visual image will eventually be accepted by your subconscious mind as instruction for your performance. 
Your ability to confront,deal with and act in spite of your fears is the key to happiness and success.

and doing things away from our comfort zone.
